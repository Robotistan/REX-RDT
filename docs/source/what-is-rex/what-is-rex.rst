What Is REX 8in1
########################

REX is an educational robot set developed by the Robotistan R&D team. The REX 8 in 1 robot set eliminates difficulties in circuit setup, such as connection points and cable confusion, with the REX Main Board using ESP32 infrastructure. Additionally, Arduino IDE, Thonny IDE, and
MicroBlocks IDE provideS great flexibility for users in programming. The REX main board is a special main board designed to facilitate the mechanical and electronic setup of robots in the 8 in 1 set. This board, which uses the ESP32E processor, has connectors to link all the
components used in the REX 8 in 1 set to the circuit using cables.


ArmBot
########
ArmBot is a REX robot that enables the movement of objects around it from one point to another using its robot arm through remote control. The robot arm on ArmBot comprises 3 servomotors. ArmBot, capable of movement in 4 different axes—up,
down, right, and left—can effortlessly reach objects even in hard-to-access areas with its mobility.

BalanceBot
#############
BalanceBot is a special robot that can maintain its balance despite physical interactions, thanks to the acceleration sensor on the REX board. You can utilize BalanceBot in situations where you require balanced object carrying.

OmniBot
#########
OmniBot provides effortless access to every point without the need for any turning movements, all thanks to its specialized omni wheels. By using OmniBot, you can conveniently reach even the most inaccessible points. This robot is designed specifically to access such challenging points.

RoverBot
#############
RoverBot is a REX robot that enables you to move comfortably in challenging terrain conditions, all thanks to its tracked structure. Like other REX 8in1 robots, you have the option to control RoverBot remotely or make it to move autonomously using specialized coding.

SonicBot
##############
SonicBot detects objects by emitting sound waves around itself, thanks to the distance sensor it has. It can perform various functions by utilizing its mechanical properties based on the values it detects. You can avoid obstacles by using SonicBot. Additionally, you can use SonicBot for tasks that involve detecting objects in the environment4

SumoBot
#############
SumoBot detects other objects on the track thanks to the HC-SR04 distance sensor and the line tracking sensor. With the help of the line tracking sensor, SumoBot detects whether objects are on the track and, as a result, moves them away from the track.

TrackerBot
############
TrackerBot emits infrared light thanks to the line tracking sensor and follows the black lines in the environment. By utilizing the mechanical features of TrackerBot along the path we have established with lines, we can enable it to autonomously carry out the tasks we desire. Additionally, we can alter the color that TrackerBot tracks by making some changes to the code.

WiBot
#######
WiBot is a REX 8in1 robot that doesn't include any additional sensors for autonomous driving; it solely permits remote control. You can conveniently control WiBot using a smartphone.
