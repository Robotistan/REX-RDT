REX, also known as Robotistan Education X, is the world's most affordable, creative, educational, and high-quality educational robot. It is a robot kit produced with Robotistan license, which is transformable and upgradable. REX - 8 in 1, with its unique design that stands out worldwide, has a structure that leaves its competitors behind with its easy-to-code interface and effective content. With this kit, you will have a transformable robot with the features you dream of. This kit was designed to be enjoyed and learned from by makers aged 9+ who are interested in coding, electronics, and mechanics.

REX is an educational robot kit developed by Robotistan R&D team. 8 in 1 robot kit, with its motherboard using the ESP32 infrastructure, eliminates the difficulties encountered in circuit setup such as port connection point and cable confusion Nonetheless, Arduino IDE, Thonny IDE and MicroBlocks IDE provide the user with great flexibility in programming.

The REX card is a special card designed to make the mechanical and electronic installations of the robots in the 8 in 1 kit more convenient. On this card, which uses the ESP32E processor, there are connectors to easily connect all the components used in the REX 8 in 1 set to the circuit with a single cable.

There is a port for connecting and 1 buzzer and switch integrated into the card, 4 motor drivers and servo motor connectors for making the installation of 8 in 1 robots and circuit designs easier on the REX card, 1 connection connector for each of the HC-SR04, TCRT5000 and MPU6050 sensors, a 7V-12V battery for the external circuit. There is a port for connecting and 1 buzzer and switch integrated into the card.
