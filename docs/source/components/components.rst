Line/IR Follower Sensor
###########################

Line follower sensors detect the presence of a black line by emitting infrared (IR) light and detecting the light levels that return to the sensor. They do this using two components:

- How to use a line follower sensor
You know a bit more how a line follower sensor works, now you should learn how to use it.

- VCC needs to be connected to a voltage in between 3.3 and 5V, to power the device
- GND is the ground pin that is required to complete the circuit
- AO is the analogue output
- DO is the digital output pin

Omni Wheels
################

Omni wheels (omniwheel) combines the freedom of 360 degree movement with the stability of a fixed mounting. This is achieved through a design which uses integral rollers rather than a swivel mount. An ideal improvement on traditional swivel casters. Omni wheels delivers improved, reliable performance for a wide range of material handling, conveyor, OEM, robotic and other applications requiring precision omni-directional maneuverability over other solutions.
